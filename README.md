# My two versions of the second project at 42 😗 *get_next_line*


### `v1`
This version wouldn't have happened without the help and patience of the two man of my programming life [rimartin](https://github.com/ricardomart26) and [ncameiri](https://github.com/ncameiri) 💖

### `v2`
Since I learned and understood the project, it was time for my own implementation 👩‍💻
